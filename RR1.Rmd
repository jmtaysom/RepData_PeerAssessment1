Reproduceable Reasearch Assignment 1
====================================
In this project we are bringing in a dataset of activity data from a fitness monitoring device. The dat includes the number of steps taken in each five minute interval of the day.
```{R}
## load Required Libraries 
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
## Download, unzip and cleanup
zip <- 'activity.zip'
url = 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'
download.file(url, zip, method='curl')
unzip(zip)
file.remove(zip)
rm(list=ls())
## Read in the data and summarise by day
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
#activity[is.na(activity)] <- 0
```
Now we want to explore the data a little more.  Lets look at a histogram, the mean, and the median of steps per day.

```{r}
daily_activity <- ddply(activity, "date", summarize, daily.steps = sum(steps))
qplot(daily.steps, data=daily_activity, geom="histogram", binwidth=1000)
mean(daily_activity$daily.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(daily_activity$daily.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```
